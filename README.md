## Features

- **Upload**: Upload a CSV file containing the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Profile**: Generate a comprehensive data profiling report using `ydata_profiling`.
- **ML**: Set up a PyCaret machine learning environment, compare models, and save the best model.
- **Download**: Download the saved best-performing model as a pickle file.
